# Yorkshire Puddings

Served with Sunday lunch

## Ingredients

- 100g plain flour
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3 large free-range eggs
- 225ml milk
- 4 tbsp sunflower oil

  ## Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 220C/200C Fan/Gas 7.
- Mix the flour and salt together in a bowl and make a well in the centre. Add the eggs and a little of the milk.   Whisk until smooth, then gradually add the remaining milk. Pour the mixture into a jug.
- Measure a teaspoon of oil into each hole of a 12-bun tray, or a tablespoonful into each hole of a 4-hole tin, or 3 tablespoons into a roasting tin. Transfer to the oven for 5 minutes, or until the oil is piping hot.
- Carefully remove from the oven and pour the batter equally between the holes or the tin. Return the batter quickly to the oven and cook for 20â€“25 minutes (35 if making the Yorkshire pudding in the roasting tin), or until golden-brown and well-risen. Serve immediately.

  ## Equipment needed

You will need a 12-hole deep bun tin or two four-hole Yorkshire pudding tins or a large roasting tin
